# Chemical Process modeling with AI ML

## AI2ChemE
### AI2ChemE â€“ Analysis and simulation of chemical processes using machine learning algorithms combined with macroscopic simulation

## DWSIM
### This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/DanWBR/dwsim)
### DWSIM is a  CAPE-OPEN compliant Chemical Process Simulator and has an easy-to-use graphical interface with many features previously available only in commercial chemical process simulators.

## Drug Discovery Using ML for Breast Cancer
### This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/getdaniel/bc-drug)
### An ML-driven application for drug discovery in breast cancer utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the pIC50 values of chemical compounds. By analyzing the relationships between compound structures and their biological activities against breast cancer, the application can provide valuable insights into the efficacy of potential drug candidates.
